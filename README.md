If you're seeing this on GitHub, it'll look a whole lot better if you clone it and open up the folder in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

As I write this I'm in the midst of converting and reformatting notes from other vaults into this one which is synced in GitHub. 

These notes aren't meant to be instructional so much as reference. Just enough to get my head back into something I haven't used in a while.
