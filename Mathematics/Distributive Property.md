One operation "over" another, e.g. the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

This is the quality that the first operation can be performed on the operands of the second individually, or the second operation can be applied first and the first operation can be applied to the result. Both orderings will give the same result.

In other words, $$A ( B + C ) = AB + AC$$
