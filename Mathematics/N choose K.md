Number of permutations when choosing $k$ items from a collection of $n$.
without replacement - can't pick same item twice
ordering doesn't matter

$${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$


Choose one item from 3: 3 permutations
$${3 \choose 1} = \frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = \frac{6}{2} = \frac{3}{1}$$ 
Choose 3 items from 6: 20 permutations
$${6 \choose 3} = \frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \frac{720}{36} = 20$$
