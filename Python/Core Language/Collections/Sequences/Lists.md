Lists are the "default option" for sequences in Python and provide a nice balance of functionality, ease, and performance.

They are Mutable, Ordered Collections.

## Creating a List
```python
>>> mylist = list()                             # []
>>> mylist = ['apple', 'banana', 3, True]       # ['apple', 'banana', 3, True]
>>> mylist = list(['apple', 'banana', 3, True]) # ['apple', 'banana', 3, True]
```

## Accessing Items
This can be done through Numeric [[Indexing and Slicing]]
