## Loop Control Statements
`break` - breaks out of loop whether or not condition is met
`next` - restarts loop at top including test

## While Loop
```ruby
while cond do
	action
end
```

## Until Loop
```ruby
until cond do
	action
end
```

## Do Loop
No condition - exits only with break
```ruby
loop do
	action
end	
```

## For Loop
Iterate through an iterable (e.g. Array, range)
```ruby
for element in myArray
	action(element)
end	
```
