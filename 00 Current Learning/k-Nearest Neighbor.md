Given a set of pre-classified points on a graph:
1. Calculate the distance of the sample point to all other points
2. Sort the distances to each point and the labels of those points.
3. Find the $k$ nearest points.
4. The most common label among those $k$ points is the label for the new point

## Distance

Various distance formulas exist to choose between, such as [[Distance Formulas]] and [[Manhattan Distance]]
